# niffy
Helps to sort and analyse past EPS and closing price returns
<br><br>
There are two csv files and two python files, <strong>newnifty.csv</strong> has the daily data from 1st January 1999 to 11th July 2024, Total 25.5 years of data is present.
<strong>niftysorted.csv</strong> has the sorted monthwise last date closing data.
<br><br>
<strong>sortnifty_data.ipynb</strong> helps to sort month wise data, from all daily data it choose the last trading day of month.
<br>
<strong>analysis.ipynb</strong> uses the sorted monthwise data to calculate the absolute past growth of EPS (earnings) and the returns of NIFTY
<br><br>
And ofcourse the python codes can be used for all types of indices and shares, nifty data is just an example here.
