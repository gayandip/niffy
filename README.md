## Helps to sort and analyse past earnings and returns

There are two steps to calculate.

- <strong>cleaning phase:</strong> download the raw past prices and valuation data from NSE website and paste those in respective files in the cleaning folder. Now execute the python script and a <strong>"data.csv" in the analysis folder</strong> will be generated where all the sorted data will be stored.

- <strong>analysis phase:</strong> Now manualy paste the desired data in the <strong>"niftysorted.csv"</strong> and execute the analysis script and the result will be generated.

Not only nifty it can calculate all index data for PE and price.
